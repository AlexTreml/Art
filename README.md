# Technical Art Project

## Unreal Project Files 

*Note - the build (windows.zip) was not downloadable and will not download correctly, as it is over the LFS *non-payment* limit, therefore GitHub have disabled LFS without payment. I have now removed this file. 
*See Task document (handed in seperately) for details of location of build*.

### Key Requirements
Unreal Engine 5:

The project must be developed using Unreal Engine 5, taking advantage of its advanced features such as Nanite for high-fidelity assets, Lumen for real-time global illumination, and optional tools like World Partition.
Advanced Technical Art Techniques:

### You are required to implement at least two of the following advanced technical art techniques:
#### Procedural Landscape Texturing, Environment Geometry, or Assets:
Use procedural techniques to generate landscapes, environments, or in-game assets. This can include procedural terrain, dynamically textured landscapes, or procedurally generated buildings or assets.
Complex Materials and Shaders:
#### Create advanced materials and shaders using Unreal Engine’s Material Editor. Examples could include dynamic landscape materials, custom shader effects (like water, glass, or holograms), and materials that react to gameplay.
Advanced VFX (Niagara or Cascade):
#### Design complex particle effects using Niagara or Cascade. These effects could include environmental effects (like fog, rain, or dust), explosions, fire, or dynamic atmospheric phenomena.
Optimisation Techniques:
#### Implement optimisation strategies to ensure the project runs efficiently in real-time. This includes using Level of Detail (LOD) for models, culling techniques, and texture streaming to ensure performance on a desktop system.
Theme “Alive”:

#### The project must explore the theme of "Alive" by incorporating dynamic and evolving elements. Consider using environmental effects, procedural animation, or any other feature that reflects life, motion, and growth in your project.
Desktop (Windows) Build:

#### Ensure the final build runs smoothly on a Windows desktop environment, with optimisation techniques applied to maintain real-time performance and graphical fidelity.


## Implementation overview. (See task document for details - handed in separately) 

### Procedural Environments:

Generated forests and coral reefs using procedural foliage and terrain generation.
Applied dynamic environmental interactions based on player movements.

### Advanced Materials:

Created water materials simulating ripples and responsive surfaces.
Enhanced lighting using Lumen for realistic reflections and shadows.

### Visual Effects:

Designed schooling fish and dynamic steam effects with Niagara particle systems.
Incorporated underwater lighting and atmospheric effects.

### Gameplay Integration:

Developed features like jump pads, teleporters, and moving platforms.
AI-driven creatures respond to environmental factors.

### Optimisation Techniques:

Used World Partition and optimised particle systems for performance.
Reduced spawn rates and utilized LODs to maintain smooth gameplay.
